# Experiment 6: Blockchain-Based Passwordless Authentication (Using Public-Private Key Cryptography)
# Aim:
To implement a secure passwordless authentication system using public-private key cryptography on Ethereum. This prevents phishing and password leaks.

# Algorithm:
Step 1: The user registers with their Ethereum address (public key) and a fake private key generated by the contract.

Step 2: The smart contract generates a random challenge message using the userâ€™s address and the current timestamp.

Step 3: The user signs the challenge with their private key, creating a signature.

Step 4: The smart contract verifies the signature by checking it against the user's public key and the challenge.

Step 5: If the signature matches, the user is authenticated successfully.

Step 6: If the signature does not match, authentication fails, preventing unauthorized access.

# Expected Output:
Users can register without a password.

# High-Level Overview:
Eliminates password hacks & phishing attacks.


Uses Ethereum's built-in cryptographic functions.


Inspired by Web3 login solutions like MetaMask authentication.

# RESULT: 
Thus, To implement a secure passwordless authentication system using public-private key cryptography on Ethereum. This prevents phishing and password leaks is executed successfully.
